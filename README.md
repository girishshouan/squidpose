Squidpose is an innovative application that uses the BlazePose algorithm to track your body movements and compare them to a workout video. 
If you're performing the same exercises as shown in the video, the video will continue playing, allowing you to follow along. If your movements do not match the workout, the video will pause until you resume the correct exercise.
